JSX and JavaScript Concepts Sprint

Project Overview

This React application demonstrates key JavaScript and React fundamentals, including variable and function hoisting, array methods (`filter`, `map`, `forEach`), and constructors, within an interactive number list interface.

Users can view, filter, and transform a list of numbers, while developers can explore how JavaScript concepts work behind the scenes.

Features

View Numbers: Displays a list of predefined numbers.
Filter Even Numbers: Filters the list to show only even numbers.
Double Numbers: Uses `map()` to display each number doubled.
Log Numbers: Iterates over the list and logs values to the console using `forEach()`.
Hoisting Demo: Demonstrates how variable and function hoisting behave in JavaScript.
Constructor Demo: Showcases object creation using a custom constructor.
